# Leather Templates
## About
These templates allow you to create your own leather items using materials and construction of your choice. Modify as needed to compensate for differences in materials. These were originally created for 8-10 oz English Bridle leather with 4 oz New Zealand deer liners.

###### 3-Ring Bondage Collar
This template is inspired by [Church of Sinvention's](https://www.churchofsinvention.com/) "DeLuxe Leather Slave Collar", modified to be a bit slimmer, with choice of slotted or round holes. Slotted holes work with locking buckles while round holes provide more adjustment points. Builder may choose lining material, hardware, and stitching color. I've had great success with 4oz New Zealand deer for liners without padding.

###### Double Rivet Cuffs
This template is inspired by [Church of Sinvention's](https://www.churchofsinvention.com/) "Padded Medical Bondage Cuffs" modified with choice of slotted or round holes and various widths. Slotted holes work with locking buckles while round holes provide more adjustment points. Builder may choose lining material, hardware, and stitching color. I've had great success with 4oz New Zealand deer for liners without padding.

## Harnesses

###### Muzzle Harness

[Prototype build](https://imgur.com/a/epwkF)

This template is inspired by the aesthetic of various muzzle harnesses I've seen around the 'net, including the Insex [face hugger](http://promo.insex.com/museum/images/face_hugger.jpg), the TiedStyle [face hugger](https://www.deviantart.com/tiedstyle/art/FaceHugger-771251797), the [Top to Bottom Leather](https://www.top-to-bottom-leathers.co.uk/Bondage-Equipment/Bondage-Gags/Ultimate-Bondage-Gag-Harness.htm) ultimate bondage gag harness, the [House of Basciano](https://www.etsy.com/shop/HouseofBasciano) padded muzzle harness, and others. It works by applying pressure to the lower jaw to hold the mouth closed. It also looks cool.
