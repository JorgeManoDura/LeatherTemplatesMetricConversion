# Leather Templates - Metric Conversion Project
## What can you make with these templates?

These are some build logs made by [VanillaLeatherCraft](https://github.com/vanillaleathercraft/leather) showing how to use the templates to make some gear:

[Brown & White "Single Rivet Cuffs"](https://imgur.com/a/bi33mpl): 8-10 oz English Bridle, 4 oz deer, slotted holes, locking buckles.

## About
Template files were created with [SketchUp Pro 2022](www.sketchup.com) and are in that application's format for easy modification as well as PDF.

These templates allow you to create your own leather items using materials and construction of your choice. Modify as needed to compensate for differences in materials. These were originally created for 8-10 oz English Bridle leather with 4 oz New Zealand deer liners.
